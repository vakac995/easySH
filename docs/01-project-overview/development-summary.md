# Project Summary & Status

**TASK DESCRIPTION:**

- Build a professional, serverless project generator with a FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend, replicating the logic and structure of three complex shell scripts.
- The generator must allow users to configure backend/frontend options via a web UI, send the config to the backend, and receive a ready-to-use ZIP file.
- Output must match the original scripts in structure, content, and conditional logic.
- Add a post-extraction setup script to the generated project for easy onboarding.
- Plan and implement a Kanban-based, gamified wizard flow for the frontend, including advanced gamification features and animations.

**COMPLETED:**

- Analyzed all three shell scripts and extracted required template components and business logic.
- Created a professional monorepo structure: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`.
- Created and organized Jinja2 templates for backend and frontend, including advanced config system files.
- Installed Python and Node.js dependencies; started backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Vite) servers.
- Fixed CORS, template rendering, and path issues; resolved Pylance errors.
- Generated a project ZIP matching the UI config, including backend and frontend.
- Validated generated project structure against all three scripts.
- Created `.env.example` and updated `package.json.jinja2` to include all required dependencies.
- Created `setup_environment.sh.jinja2` template for post-extraction setup.
- Updated `main.py` to render and include `setup_environment.sh` in the ZIP archive.
- Planned and documented a Kanban-based, gamified wizard flow for the frontend in `tasks/gamified_wizard_plan.md`.
- **Implemented the full gamified wizard frontend, including:**
  - A multi-step form structure with a progress bar.
  - Components for each step: `Welcome`, `Backend`, `Frontend`, `Modules`, and `Review`.
  - A friendly mascot with animations to guide the user.
  - State management for the configuration object.
  - Prop validation using `prop-types`.
  - **Integrated Framer Motion for advanced animations.**
  - **Implemented an achievement system with dynamic unlocking.**
  - **Added a "Power Level" feature to gamify feature selection.**
  - **Created a "Celebration" animation upon successful project generation.**
  - **Added micro-interactions and polished animations for buttons, steps, and other UI elements.**
  - **Connected the frontend to the backend API for project generation.**

**PENDING:**

- Further refine the setup script or templates based on user feedback or additional requirements.
- Continue thorough validation as new features are added.
- Polish UI/UX and add more micro-interactions if needed.

**CODE STATE:**

- `d:\private\easySH\backend\main.py` (FastAPI app, template rendering, ZIP logic)
- `d:\private\easySH\backend\templates\*` (All Jinja2 templates)
- `d:\private\easySH\frontend\src\App.jsx` (Main frontend component)
- `d:\private\easySH\frontend\src\components\wizard\*` (All wizard components, including new gamification elements like `Celebration.jsx`)
- `d:\private\easySH\frontend\src\components\achievements\*` (Achievement components)
- `d:\private\easySH\frontend\src\components\gamification\*` (Gamification components like `PowerLevel.jsx`)
- `d:\private\easySH\tasks\gamified_wizard_plan.md` (Kanban plan for gamified wizard)
- `d:\private\easySH\tasks\project_summary.md` (This file)

**CHANGES:**

- Created/organized all necessary directories and files for a professional monorepo.
- Added Jinja2 templates for all backend and frontend files.
- Updated frontend to POST config to backend and handle ZIP download.
- Added CORS middleware to FastAPI backend.
- Fixed path and environment issues for running backend/frontend servers.
- Refactored backend file generation logic for correct ZIP structure.
- Created `setup_environment.sh.jinja2` and updated `main.py` to include it.
- **Implemented a fully-featured gamified wizard with animations, achievements, power levels, and a celebration screen, completing the frontend development phase as per the plan.**
- Installed `framer-motion` and `prop-types` to support the new frontend features.
- Refactored frontend components to incorporate animation and gamification logic.

**Key tool calls:**

- Directory and file creation, file edits, template rendering, dependency installation, server startup, directory listings, and file reads for validation and implementation.
